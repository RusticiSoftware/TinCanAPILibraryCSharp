This library provides the TCAPI class which allows you to communicate with an LRS (Specified as an endpoint).  If you are looking to simply use TinCan, using the TCAPI Class, making an instance of it and using the provided methods will likely cover all your needs - it provides some simple Async support along with many helper methods.  If you need something more focused or specific to the implementation, implement the ITCAPI interface and build the TCAPI class.
