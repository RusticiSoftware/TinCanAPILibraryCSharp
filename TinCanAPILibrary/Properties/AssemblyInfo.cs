If you are looking to simply use TinCan, using the TCAPI Class, making an instance of it and using the provided methods will likely cover all your needs - it provides some simple Async support along with many helper methods.  If you need something more focused or specific to the implementation, implement the ITCAPI interface and build the TCAPI class.")]
